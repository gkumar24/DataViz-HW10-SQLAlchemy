# Home Work Assignment - SQL Alchemy

# Assignment Scope

* Precipitation Analysis: 
    * Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data, Plot the results. 
* Station Analysis: 
    * Design a query to calculate the total number of stations.
    * Design a query to find the most active stations, based on the observation count.
    * Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (tobs), for the most active station, and plot in histogram
* Climate App:
    * Create Flask app to out out the Precipitation & Station Analysis as JSON data. 

## Climate Analysis - Jupyter Notebook.
